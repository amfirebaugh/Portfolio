# Portfolio

Welcome to My Portfolio, which is always a work in progress as I continue to learn new things!

### Features

Currently my portfolio features a brief brand statement, several of my latest projects, a few lists of my favorite learning tools, and contact information.

### Technologies

This site was built using Materialize as a CSS framework. I'm using the Scrollspy jQuery plugin by Materialize since this is a brochure-style site.

### Future Development

I wish to continue working on the responsiveness of the site by working with the media queries. As I learn new technologies such as React.js, those could also become useful for possible features.
